Description: Survey Satisficing is a threat to data quality as it significantly contributes to measurement bias.
    It is usually not a walk in the park to systematically investigate this 
    behavior after data collection. 
    Nevertheless, it is essential in order to assess the validity and 
    reliability of the data collected. This package provides useful functions 
    that can significantly reduce the effort involved.
